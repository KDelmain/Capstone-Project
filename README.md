# Capstone-Project

This repo contains my capstone project for my bachelor's degree in software development.

In the documentation folder you can find the requirements for this project as well as detailed documentation written by me that include the business case, requirements, timelines and projected costs, test results, UI screenshots, and a full user guide.
